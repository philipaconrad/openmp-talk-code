OpenMP Talk Exercises and Solutions
-----------------------------------

This repo contains the code for the talk: *A Hands-On Intro to Parallel Programming with OpenMP*

## What's here

 - `exercises/` :: Folder of example exercises. Try running the `hello-world` example to make sure your OpenMP setup works.
 - `solutions/` :: Reference solutions for the exercises.


## Build

If you're on a Linux-like system, running `make` should build and benchmark each example.


## How to debug your work

 - [Valgrind][valgrind] :: Amazing memory analysis tool. It can help you find memory leaks, and out-of-bounds accesses.
 - [GDB][gdb] :: A powerful debugger, and the standard for debugging on Linux-like operating systems.
